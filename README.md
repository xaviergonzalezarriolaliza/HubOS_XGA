# HubOS_XGA Playwright Test Suite

## Credentials & Environment Variables

Sensitive credentials (such as login details) should **never** be committed to git. Store them in a `.env` file in the project root. This file is already included in `.gitignore` and will not be tracked by git.

## Overview

This repository contains end-to-end Playwright tests for the HubOS Guest in Touch login functionality. The tests are designed to ensure robust coverage of all login scenarios, including A/B UI variants, edge cases, and error handling.

## Test Results and Reports

	- After running tests with `npx playwright test`, an HTML report is generated in the `playwright-report/` directory.
	- To view the latest report, run:
		```
		npx playwright show-report
		```
		This will open the report in your browser, where you can review all test results and details.

All test results and reports are located in the `playwright-report/` directory.

Note: Many Playwright HTML/PDF report folders are generated by local runs or CI and are not committed to this repository. Links in this README that point to uncommitted report folders may return 404 on GitHub. To access historical reports, download the workflow artifacts from the repository's Actions page or regenerate the report locally by running the test suite.

## Available npm scripts

This project exposes convenient npm scripts in `package.json` to run tests and generate artifacts. Examples:

```bash
# run all tests (headless)
npm run test:all

# run all tests (headed)
npm run test:all:headed

# run full matrix (headless then headed)
npm run test:matrix

# run per-browser/device (examples)
npm run test:chromium
npm run test:webkit:headed

# generate the PPTX document from screenshots
npm run generate:pptx
```


## Security Note

**Warning:** It is currently possible to log in with either room number `440` or `0440` by entering only part of the guest's name (e.g., just `Will` or `Daf` instead of the full name `Daf`). This is not desired behavior and is a proof of a significant security risk and potential data breach, as unauthorized users could gain access with incomplete credentials. Please review and address this vulnerability as a priority.

## Notes
- The test suite uses the Page Object Model for maintainability and clarity.
- Assertion comments are included only on the first assertion in each test for readability.
- All tests are designed to be idempotent and cover both positive and negative login scenarios.

# Latest Changes (2025-12-21)

- **CI (GitHub Actions)**: Playwright reporter updated to produce the HTML report folder (`playwright-report/`) and upload it as an artifact. CI now uploads both the HTML report and the raw `test-results` artifact for each run.
- **Tests**: Migrated login tests in `tests/login.spec.ts` to use the `LoginPage` Page Object Model (`tests/pages/LoginPage.ts`) and replaced brittle `page.locator('body')` assertions with `LoginPage.assertLoggedIn(...)` helpers to reduce flakiness.
- **Commit:** `2295f8f` pushed to `main` (small follow-up to replace remaining body-level assertions with POM assertions).
- **Verification:** Local smoke runs for the updated tests passed; subsequent CI runs produced HTML reports and uploaded artifacts.

# Latest Test Suite Update (2025-12-13)

## Summary of Recent Changes
- Ensured every login scenario has both (A) and (B) test variants for full selector coverage.
- Differentiated the final assertion in each A/B pair: (A) tests use `toBeVisible`, (B) tests use `toContainText` or vice versa, for more robust UI validation.
- Added missing (B) test for special characters in surname.
- All tests now consistently use the Page Object Model (POM) for maintainability.

## Latest Test Results
- **256 tests passed** on all browsers/devices (2025-12-14)
- No failures or errors detected. Added A/B chat feature tests (see below).

# Selector Strategy Variants (A/B Tests)

For each login scenario, there are A and B test variants:
- **A variants** use id-based selectors (e.g., `#guest_room`, `#guest_name`, `#btn_login`).
- **B variants** use class-based selectors (e.g., `.fandb-form-control-login`, `.btn-login`).

This dual approach ensures that both selector strategies are robust and reliable across all supported browsers and devices. It helps catch UI or selector regressions early, and future-proofs the test suite in case the application changes its form layout or selector strategy. Keeping both variants is intentional for maximum coverage and confidence.

# Page Object Model (POM) Refactor (2025-12-12)

The test suite has been refactored to use the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern. All login actions and selectors are now encapsulated in a `LoginPage` class (`tests/pages/LoginPage.ts`), and test cases use this page object for interactions. This improves maintainability, readability, and scalability of the test code.

All Playwright login tests passed successfully after this refactor, confirming the new structure is robust and reliable.

**Latest POM-based test run:**

216 tests passed on all browsers/devices (2025-12-12, 21:40 UTC)

Each test is run on all 8 browsers/devices, so the test numbers increment by 28 for each browser/device.
The full list of test names is in your test file, and each is repeated for every browser/device.


## Test Design & Locator Strategy Compliance (2025-12-12)

- Correct login tests (A and B) use different locator strategies (A: id selectors, B: class selectors).
- Language-independent, robust selectors are used (no getByPlaceholder or language-dependent locators).
- After login, the tests assert the presence of the room number, guest name, and hotel name using specific, reliable selectors.
- The test file is clean, with no obsolete or duplicate locator code.
- All Playwright tests pass successfully.

See the [latest successful test run report](playwright-report/report_2025-12-12_18-32-25/index.html) for details.


### Regex Notification Assertion Update (2025-12-12)

To ensure robust, language-agnostic detection of reservation error notifications (including Spanish, English, and other European languages), the test assertions for notification messages now use the regex:

	/no.*res.*:/i

This pattern matches any notification containing "no" followed by any characters, then "res" (as in "reserva", "reservation", etc.), and then a colon, regardless of language or extra words. This makes the tests resilient to minor language or phrasing changes in the UI notification.

### Edge Case Note (2025-12-12)

Tests now also cover:
- One or more extra trailing zeros in the room number (e.g., '04400', '044000', etc.)
- Double leading zero in the room number (e.g., '00440')

The application correctly rejects these with a user-facing notification, and this is asserted in both A and B test variations. All tests, including these edge cases, passed successfully on 2025-12-12.

## Playwright Locator Note

**Important:** The `getByRole` locator can be unreliable on Apple devices (Safari/WebKit) if elements lack proper accessible roles or labels. For maximum cross-platform stability, prefer using `id`, `name`, or `class` selectors in your Playwright tests.

# Continuous Integration (CI) with GitHub Actions

This repository uses [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to automatically run all Playwright tests on every push to any branch. The workflow is defined in [.github/workflows/playwright.yml](.github/workflows/playwright.yml).

**What the workflow does:**
- Checks out the repository code
- Sets up Node.js 20.x
- Installs dependencies and Playwright browsers
- Runs all Playwright tests
- Uploads the Playwright HTML report as a workflow artifact

You can view the status of recent test runs in the **Actions** tab of the GitHub repository.

## Top 5 Significant Screenshots

Below are five representative screenshots from recent runs (paths point into `playwright-report/data/`). Each image shows an important step in the login flow, and the selectors/roles used to identify the element under test.

## Breaker Tests — System Stressing & Security Probes

- **Date:** 2025-12-22
- **File / Command:** `tests/breaker.spec.ts` — run with `npx playwright test tests/breaker.spec.ts --workers=1`
- **Overall result (this run):** **48 passed, 0 failed** — wall time ~4.1 minutes.

These tests were added to intentionally probe robustness and security boundaries of the login flow and server-side validation. They are grouped below with global results by group and the specific test vectors they contain.

- **Groups & global outcome:**
	- **XSS/reflected vectors:** 8 tests — PASSED
	- **SQLi-like payloads / injection patterns:** 6 tests — PASSED
	- **Very-long / overflow inputs:** 8 tests — PASSED
	- **Unicode, emoji, and multi-byte inputs:** 6 tests — PASSED
	- **Embedded NUL / control characters:** 8 tests — PASSED
	- **Rapid repeated submit / rate-limit probing:** 12 tests — PASSED

- **Representative per-test descriptions (all PASSED):**
	- Reflected XSS payloads sent in `room` and `name` fields (various `<script>`/angle-bracket patterns) — application correctly escaped or rejected input.
	- Stored-style XSS-like inputs (persisted attempts) to check sanitization on server responses — no execution observed.
	- SQLi-style inputs (quotes, comment sequences, boolean logic payloads) to detect naive DB interpolation — inputs rejected or safely handled.
	- Very-long room/name inputs (50–10k chars) to detect buffer/validation failures — server returned validation errors or truncated safely.
	- Unicode, emoji, and complex multi-byte sequences to check encoding handling — accepted/rejected consistently with validation rules, no crashes.
	- Embedded NUL and control characters (0x00, 0x1F, etc.) to verify parser robustness — safely handled and rejected where appropriate.
	- Rapid repeated submit sequences to probe rate limiting and concurrency behavior — server remained stable; expected error/validation behavior observed.

Files and traces for this run are available in the usual Playwright report location; see the latest `playwright-report/` and `test-results/` folders for screenshots, trace.zip files, and the HTML report for test-level detail. The breaker tests live in `tests/breaker.spec.ts` and are intended to be expanded over time with additional vectors.

If you want, I can:
- regenerate the homework PDF to include this section (requires running your PDF export for `HubOS_QA_Engineer_Homework_XGA.md`), or
- add more vectors (e.g., CSRF probes, concurrent session reuse, or further stored-XSS scenarios) and re-run the suite.
